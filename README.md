# JakeGuy11
Welcome to my GitHub page! I have over 8 years of coding experience with both software-only languages and hardware-interfacing languages. My focus isn't currently on software, as I am a student at the University of Waterloo for Materials and Nanosciences, although I will occasionally update projects.\
I am also a secondary school tutor, specializing in math, computer programming and the sciences. Please contact me if you're interested, my contact info can be found below!\
Additionally, I speak some French and Japanese (conversational in French, beginner in Japanese). I'm always looking to practice so feel free to contact me in either of those languages as well!

I've been using Java, Arduino, and C#/.NET for the longest, and I'm most proficient with Linux sytems, Rust and C++. I'm a FIRST Robotics alumni from team [7722](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/7722/), where I was the lead software on and was when we won the district event at Western University in our rookie year as well.\
I use Arch with DWM (Dynamic Window Manager) on my main computer, so I'm most experienced and comfortable writing command line applications for UNIX/Mac systems in Rust and C++, although I'm also familiar with the syntax and common libraries for Python, along with the web applications for JavaScript.
## Hobbies/Interests
- I'm very passionate about chemistry and physics. I regularly attend the Public Lecture series at the Permiter Institute and I have a special interest in quantum physics and computing.
- I do archery, although I've only just started again after a several year break (through the pandmeic). I hope to become competitive again soon!
- I'm a woodworker and metalsmith/bladesmith. I'm still fairly inexperienced but I've produced several final pieces that I'm proud of.
- I love learning languages; I'm in the process of learning French and Japanese, and in the future I'd like to learn Korean, Portuguese and some slavic language.
